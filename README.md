The project Introduces a unique and cost effective solution for Xerox shops - a comprehensive web and mobile application that enables vendors to take their business online, without the burden of expensive CRM systems. At present, many vendors are unable to make the transition to online platforms due to the increased costs associated with acquiring and maintaining these systems. But with our innovative pay-as-you-go model, vendors can finally embrace the digital age without having to pay any upfront costs.

Our solution not only benefits vendors but also provides a seamless experience for customers. The mobile app, which is free to download, enables customers to easily place orders and track their progress from the convenience of their own devices. This eliminates the need for customers to visit the shop in person, saving them time and effort.

With our cost-effective and user-friendly solution, we aim to bridge the gap between traditional Xerox shops and the online world. By offering a pay-as-you-go model, we ensure that vendors only pay when they are profitable, eliminating the risk of costly investments. Our application is the perfect solution for both vendors and customers, allowing for a seamless and efficient experience.
